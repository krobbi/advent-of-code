# Advent of Code
These are my attempts at solving puzzles from
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an annual advent calendar of
programming puzzles. I am using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and avoiding
using any dependencies for puzzle solutions.

Puzzle inputs are not included in this repository by request of the
[Advent of Code FAQ](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying).

Puzzle inputs are given similar names to the code that solves them. For
example, the puzzle input for `src/advent_of_code_2015/day_1_not_quite_lisp.rs`
should be located at `inputs/advent_of_code_2015/day_1_not_quite_lisp.txt`.
